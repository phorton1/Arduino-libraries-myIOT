# Shared JS, CSS, and HTML files

The myIOT/data directory contains a version of jquery, bootstrap,
and some common JS, CSS, and HTML that is shared between Esp32
myIOT projects, as well as to the Perl apps::myIOTServer project.

The file captive.html is self contained and does not load any
additional JS, CSS, or HTML, and is only used in Esp32 projects.

In Esp32 projects, the entire contents of the /data directory
are uploaded to the **flat** SPIFFS file system and served from
there statically. A request to '/' gets turned into **index.html**,
which theen causes the browser to request the JS and CSS from the
HTTP Server.

The directory is called 'data' becuase that is the standard name
of an Arduino project directory that you upload to a SPIFFS
file system.


## Vestigial Design

Because SPIFFS is a flat file system, in the initial implentation
we simply mapped '/' to 'index.html' and serve any otherwise unhandled
requests as simple absolute file requests, thus serving any files that
are found on the SPIFFS system as 'root' files.

The bilgeAlarm stores the history.dat file in the root of the
SPIFFS as well, but it is never uploaded to the ESP32.  The clocks
don't upload anything special to, or otherwise use, the SPIFFS.

Super duper care was taken when implementing the Perl myIOTServer
to use the same common index.HTML, and the JS and CSS from the
/data directory.  The JS and CSS are *slightly* but **significantly**
modified to work with the myIOTServer to redirect to a given specific
device that is known to the myIOTServer.

The myIOTServer not make use of captive.html. Care would have to
be taken to change the Wifi Host or Credentials in any myIOT thing
via any UI, as the very act of doing so **may** cause the connection
to be lost (the wifi host and credentials should only be picked up
in a reboot).


# Denormalization

In any case, the issue of normalizing this source code has become
a bit onerous.  As I mentioned, it currently exists 6 times in
my github repos:

	/src/Arduino/libraries/myIOT/data - the 'master' copy
	/src/Arduino/libraries/myIOT/examples/testDevice/data
	/src/Arduino/bilgeAlarm/data
	/src/Arduino/theClock/data - unused code, really
	/src/Arduino/bilgeAlarm/data
	/base/apps/myIOTServer/site

It is particularly problematic in myIOTServer, where the /site
directory also contains:

	admin.html
	admin.js
	standard_system.js - also denormalized
	favicon.ico (not currently on ESP32, we may want different in each device)

The issue arises because I also want to normalize 'standard_system.h' somehow,
and, in fact, change it to 'standard_utils.js'.  Also of significance is that
the entire Inventory jquery is essentially a copy of that from Artisan with
an added 'DataTables', and minus 'fancyTree'.


There are a few other 'denormalized' files in my git repos, including
/src/circle/_prh/_apps/Looper/commonDefines.h which is copied to
/src/Arduino/teensyExpression and /src/Arduino/teensyExpression2, but
for now I am not going to worry about that, and just try to think about
the common HTML, JS, and CSS.


## Git Submodules

My idea is to use git submodules in all but one of the projects.
In this case, the /src/Arduino/Libraries/myIOT/data directory would become
a new standalone repo with 'exclusion' in .gitignore like I currently
do for Perl sublibraries.  This exclusion would need to be tested
as myIOT is much more nested than /base/My and /base/Pub, but I think
it can be made to work.

The other projects would then use the git submodules thing. Without
going into too much detail, that would STILL create some issues:

- working on the submodule in one project, what does it mean to
  commit and push it?  Within the project?
- updating the other ones to re-fetch the modified module
- working in my gitUI program


## Testing - Theory

I don't feel confident just making this change to my actual source.
I think I need to create a copy of test projects in /junk for this
and add them to github ... the whole 9 yards ...

Which in turn puts me up agains the 100 file limit for github
repo calls in gitUI::reposGitHub.pm.

Which in turn means that I should clean up junk, and get
rid of any superflous _old source directories, just for sanity.

## Test Repos

OK, so now that /junk/test_repo2 is setup with a submodule
copy_sub1 to the junk-test_repo1-test_sub1 repo, and I have
made changes and commited and pushed them from both, I have
learned the following:

- submodules are just separate repositories
- if I make a change in either sub-repo, I still have
  to commit and/or push that change from within the
  given sub-repo.
- submodules do not show up, at this time, in my gitUI
  so I cannot currently make those commits/pushes from
  my gitUI.
- other copies of the sub-repos still have to be pulled
  or fetched and rebased manually.
- a commit to a submodule, as opposed to a commit to
  the master sub-repo, which is completely ignored,
  causes a need for a commit of that revision of the
  sub-module within the including main repo/

The difference is that in the main test_repo1, test_sub is
completely ignored, so a change to it has no effect on the
underlying test_repo1, whereas in test_repo2, whenever I
make a change there, including pulling the submodule,
the test_repo2 requires a commit of the copy_sub1 submodule
revision.

All this makes perfect sense.  In fact it *would* support the
idea that if I make changes to multiple different sub-repos,
that those changes conceivably need to be MERGED, as I am
really working on the same repo in two different places.


## Incorporation into my gitUI

I obvioiusly need to be able to commit and push from any
submodule from within my git-ui.

I suspect that I need to know where the submodules are
in my git_repositories.txt.

For example, the master sub-repo could list the other
repos that include it, and/or the including repos could
explicitly mention that they have submodules at given
paths.

The first stab is just to add the submodules as entirely
separate repositories into my git_repositories.txt.

I suspect a manual 'normalize' process will be needed,
so that it is not onerous for gitUI to always be fetching
and looking for changes in the sub-repos, but to provide
an easy way, for the simplest case of working on a sub-repo
from one location at a time only.   This would be similar
to the Update features I added to Artisan, myIOTServer,
and the inventory app, the difference being that it would
check all instances that might need an update, fetch them
all, pull them all, and even possibly make the 'submodule
commit' within the other repos that include the submodule.

Merely treaating them as completely separate repos will work,
will not have any actual significant problems, but will not
provide for an easy normaliztion process, particularly if
there are simultaneous changes in multiple copies.
